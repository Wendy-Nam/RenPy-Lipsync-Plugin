## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Feature

### 1. Asynchronous Lip-Sync

Synchronize lip animations with voice-over lines for immersive storytelling.

### 2. User-Driven Termination

Seamlessly terminate voice-over and lip-sync upon user interaction (e.g., skipping dialogue) for uninterrupted gameplay.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. Download Rhubarb Lip Sync

- Begin by downloading the suitable version of `Rhubarb Lip Sync` from the [official repository](https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync/releases) that corresponds to your operating system.
  - If you are on macOS, ensure you select the macOS version.

### 2. Copy Plugin Directory

- To incorporate the plugin into your Ren'Py project, copy the entire `lip-sync-plugin` directory from this repository and place it within your project's main directory.

### 3. Add Rhubarb Executable

- Inside the `lip-sync-plugin` directory, insert the downloaded `Rhubarb Lip Sync` executable file.
- Replace the existing version of Rhubarb-Lip-Sync with your new one.

### 4. Prepare Audio Files

- For your project's voice-over audio files, arrange them in the `audio/voice` directory.
- üö® Important: Ensure that these audio files are in the `.wav` or `.ogg` format.

### 5. Generate Lip Sync Data

Execute the `generate_lipsync_data.py` script located in the `lip-sync-plugin` directory. This script generates lip-sync data files for your audio files in the `lip-sync-data` subdirectory.
Run the following code in the `lip-sync-plugin` directory:

```bash
python3 generate_lipsync_data.py
```

After execution, observe the generated subdirectories and files in the lip-sync-data directory:

![alt-text-2](./README/lipsync-data.png "title-1")

## üéÆ Integration

## Integrate Lip Sync Animations

With the lip-sync data files prepared, proceed to integrate lip-sync animations into your game using the provided template:

```renpy
define lisa = Character("lisa", color="#ffffff")

layeredimage lisa:
    zoom 3.0
    group mouth:
        attribute mouth_A:
            "lisa-A.png"
        attribute mouth_B:
            "lisa-B.png"
        attribute mouth_C:
            "lisa-C.png"
        attribute mouth_D:
            "lisa-D.png"
        attribute mouth_E:
            "lisa-E.png"
        attribute mouth_F:
            "lisa-F.png"
        attribute mouth_G:
            "lisa-G.png"
        attribute mouth_H:
            "lisa-H.png"
        attribute mouth_X default:
            "lisa-X.png"

# Note: Lip-sync requires audio files in .wav format.
# Note: Prepare lip-sync data using generate_lipsync_data.py.

label start:
    # show lisa at left
    show lisa at center
    "Hello, I'm lisa."
    "Watch me lip-sync."
    # Play the lip-sync animation for the given audio file.
    # parameters are : character, audio file, text to display
    $ lipsync(lisa, "what-can-i-do-for-you-npc-british-male-99751.wav", "What can I do for you?")
    $ lipsync(lisa, "ah-good-morning-sir-would-you-like-a-cup-of-tea.ogg", \
        "Ah, good morning sir. Would you like a cup of tea?")
    "Thank you for watching!"
```
